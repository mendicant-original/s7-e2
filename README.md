# RMU SESSION 7 EXERCISE 2

If in doubt about how to submit, see SUBMISSION_GUIDELINES file.

In this exercise, we'll be designing and building a proof of concept
implementation for a conversation simulator, something akin to the famous ELIZA
program ( http://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/ ). Please keep the following
guidelines in mind while working on this problem.

## GUIDELINES

* This project has two main parts: The first is to discuss the problem as 
  a group and talk about possibly design strategies after nailing down the 
  minimum requirements as well as any 'would be nice' features. The second
  is for each student to build a usable prototype based on the ideas 
  discussed among the whole group.

* The less you participate in the design discussions, the more you are 
  expected to have an especially innovative and well polished prototype 
  to submit. However, even those who are very active in the discussions are
  expected to have a working prototype of their own if they want to receive
  credit for this assignment.

* Your prototype may take on a limited subset of the goal of having a fully
  functional conversation simulator, but the code itself should both do
  something useful and be well written. Even though this is a prototype, it is
  not a spike, so any loose ends should be tied up or cleanly stubbed out,
  making for a clean codebase.

* Your simulator should have at least some basic seed data for simulating a
  conversation, but it's up to you how creative you want to be. A fun simulation
  is a bonus, but we mainly care about what your engine can do, not how exciting
  the conversation it generates is.

* The user interface for your bot can be anything you want, but needn't be more
  complicated than a simple text based interface on the command line. Feel free
  to share UI code with the whole group, to cut down on duplication.

* Make sure you don't get sucked too far into requirements discovery, this 
  problem is *much* bigger than what can reasonably be done in a few weeks, 
  so just carve off a slice and be sure to leave time for your other assignments.

* HAVE FUN!

## QUESTIONS?

Hit up the mailing list or IRC. RMU exercises are left deliberately open ended,
and often benefit from some discussion before, during, and after you work on
them.
